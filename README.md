# GA4SO (Goanimate for Schools Online)
Goanimate for Schools Online is a project that revives the legacy of the original GA4S by bringing it online. With this project, you will get working starters, an account page, a good looking notification page, and more! And please know that half of this is still in beta. So some stuff might not work.
# Bugs
1. Importing doesn't work
2. Starters don't save yet.
3. If the account system page doesn't work or the notifications, it will be replaced with GoAnimate for Schools 404 page.
